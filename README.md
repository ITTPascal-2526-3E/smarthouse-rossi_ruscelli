SmartHouse Automation System is a program designed to manage a smart home. It allows you to control different devices such as lights, sensors, thermostats, and locks, and it shows real-time data like temperature, humidity, and motion. The system also lets you create automations, for example turning off the lights when no one is home or sending notifications when something important happens.
You can use the program through an interface available on a computer or a phone. All settings can be changed in a configuration file or through environment variables.
Installation is done by downloading the project and installing the required dependencies for the programming language used, such as Python or Node.js. Once the server is started, the interface can be opened in a browser at the address provided by the program.
The project structure is simple. It includes files that manage the devices, the internal services, the user interface, and the configuration. There are also tests to check that everything is working correctly.
Anyone can contribute by adding new features or improving the code. The project is released with a free license that allows modification and improvement.
